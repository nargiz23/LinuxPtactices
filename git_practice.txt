We will send  our linuxpractices folder from linux machine to 
github remote repository.In order to send this folder,
we have to initialize the git on the LinuxPractices folder.
We should use git add commit for adding the files we want on a git
can say that git staging area.Staging areas is still on our local devices,but
we can say that git staging is a between remote and local.Before we send
all the codes in a github remote repository,we should include the message to them
so we can know purpose of the files.
Then we can create a main branch on the github,then add our credentials,and send it.
